### ‚öôÔ∏è  Architecture snapshot

| Layer              | Tech & techniques                                                                | Why it matters                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data ingest**    | Power Query + M, parameterised functions, REST connectors                        | Normalises 8 mismatched sources, auto-heals schema drift       |
| **Storage/model**  | Star schema, agg tables, VertiPaq compression, Tabular Editor                    | Holds 10 M+ rows yet keeps visuals < 2 s                       |
| **Business logic** | Advanced DAX (measure branching, calc groups), Time-Intelligence, What-If params | Dynamic P\&L, GM% waterfalls, forecast accuracy, anomaly flags |
| **Ops**            | Incremental refresh, XMLA deployment scripts, Dev/Test/Prod workspaces           | Push-button CI/CD; 6-minute nightly refresh                    |
| **Governance**     | Row-level & object-level security, KPI dictionary, change-log                    | Everyone sees the right data‚Äîand agrees on the definition      |
| **UX**             | Bookmark-driven nav, tooltip drill-throughs, responsive layouts                  | Two-click glide from board KPIs to SKU/customer detail         |

### üõ†  Engineering hurdles & how I crushed them

| Pain point                | Solution                                                                 | Result                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Silos & dirty data        | Re-usable M ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù wrappers, Power Query dataflows                    | 90 % less manual prep                  |
| Sluggish visuals          | Aggregation tables + calc groups; switched to composite model            | Avg load 11 s ‚Üí 1.8 s                  |
| KPI mismatch across teams | Facilitated SME workshops, codified metrics in a governed DAX dictionary | Ended ‚Äúwhose number is right?‚Äù debates |
| Weekend-long refreshes    | Incremental refresh + partition pruning                                  | 14 h refresh ‚Üí 6 min nightly           |
